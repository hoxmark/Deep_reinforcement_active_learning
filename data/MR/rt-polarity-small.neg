this film biggest problem ? no laughs .
less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan .

to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .
the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types .
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood .

john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling .

a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .

a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater .
bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste .

hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .

typical animé , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names .

the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .
it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .

 if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a

it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .

like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool .

it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction .

the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos .
intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story's least interesting subject .
a non-mystery mystery .
feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
what an embarrassment .
for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .

i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal .
the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one .

new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . .
the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
